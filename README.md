Code release for the paper 'Animal diversity and ecosystem functioning in dynamic food webs'
===========================================================================================

by Florian D. Schneider, Ulrich Brose, Bj√∂rn C. Rall & Christian Guill

This repository contains simulation code and code for statistical analysis of a research project. It applies allometric models of animal foraging and network structure to simulate the ecosystem-level stocks and rates of animal and plant biomass in relation to the number of animal species present in the ecosystem. 

## Code in this repository.

1. `code/pdef_dynamics_2.4.c` & `code/pdef_dynamics_1.1.h`: Original simulation code. This was compiled and run in multiple instances for simulations over the entire gradient of 10 to 100 animal species with a single file output file for each instance found in `data/pdef_2.4/`. Additional instances were run for sensitivity analyses and are found in the same location. 
2. `code/data.r` : Data collect and compilation. The file reads in all output files, corrects some columns, calculates additional columns and saves everything into a single output file `data/webstats.txt`. Seperate files are created for the sensititvity analyses. Column names correspond do parameters as used in simulation code and slightly differ from nomenclature in the article.
3. `code/analyse.r` : contains function `analyse()` which fits the statistical models describing the relationships between animal diversity and ecosystem function. Call using `analyse(webstats$S_c_fin, webstats$meanB_c, equation = TRUE, ylab = "")`
4. `code/sensitivity.r` : contains function `sensitivity()` for calling the sensitivity analysis for any parameter x, as well as function `sensitivity_plus()` for visualising the simulations of the alternative model runs. 
4. `code/analysis.r` : applies function `analyse()` to return the result figure 4 and 5 of the paper and an overview output table. applies functions in sensitivity.r to return sensitivity analysis of Supplementary Material. 

## Comments welcome

We encourage testing or reviewing this simulation code. Any comments, bug reports or mistakes should be reported in the [Github issues](https://github.com/fdschneider/schneider_et_al_2016_animaldiversity/issues).
