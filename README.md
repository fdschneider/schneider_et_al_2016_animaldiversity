Code release for the paper 'Animal diversity and ecosystem functioning in dynamic food webs'
===========================================================================================

by Florian D. Schneider, Ulrich Brose, Bj√∂rn C. Rall & Christian Guill

This repository contains simulation code and code for statistical analysis of a research project. It applies allometric models of animal foraging and network structure to simulate the ecosystem-level stocks and rates of animal and plant biomass in relation to the number of animal species present in the ecosystem. 

## Code in this repository.

1. `code/pdef_dynamics_2.4.c` & `code/pdef_dynamics_1.1.h`: Original simulation code. This was compiled and run in multiple instances for simulations over the entire gradient of 10 to 100 animal species with a single file output file for each instance found in `data/pdef_2.4/`. Additional instances were run for sensitivity analyses and are found in the same location. 
2. `code/data.r` : Data collect and compilation. The file reads in all output files, corrects some columns, calculates additional columns and saves everything into a single output file `data/webstats.txt`. Seperate files are created for the sensititvity analyses. 
3. `code/analysis.r` : fits the statistical models describing the relationships between animal diversity and ecosystem function and returns a summary table and the result figure 4 of the paper. 
4. `code/supplementarymaterial.Rmd` : original code for Online Supplementary Discussion; contains code and interpretation for the full sensitivity analysis.  The document is written in [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) (compilation to pdf or docx requires R packages rmarkdown, knitr and pandoc; individual code chunks can be run independently in R).

## Comments welcome

We encourage testing or reviewing this simulation code. Any comments, bug reports or mistakes should be reported in the [Github issues](https://github.com/fdschneider/schneider_et_al_2016_animaldiversity/issues).
